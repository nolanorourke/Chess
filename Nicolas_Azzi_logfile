Log File from Nicolas Azzi

With less than a month to complete this project, Nolan and I were able to build
an efficient Chess board game. Underneath is the log of what I did and for what day.

Dec 6.
    -- Added most constraints on pieces where you could "play" a game of chess

Dec 7.
    -- Worked mostly on constraints trying to get a proper game of chess
    -- Fixed errors/bugs with certain pieces and did some exception bounds

Dec 8.
    -- Worked all day on game constraints
    -- Fixed errors/bugs with all pieces and finished with exception bounds
    -- Removed prints for debugging to get ready for inital launch
