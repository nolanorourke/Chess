# Chess
### Nicolas Azzi and Nolan O'Rourke
For our final project, we decided to create a Chess game. It involves all the necessary pieces with their own pictures, a turn tracker on the top, a most history table on the east side of the panel, and a menu on the bottom.
## How To Play
We added an instrction link attached to a button on the bottom right to give the user instructions on how to play
